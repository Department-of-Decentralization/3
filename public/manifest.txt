ETHBerlin^3 - Expect us!
========================

Hey friend! Remember us? We know it has been a while.

In fact, the world seems to have changed drastically since we last met in Berlin
in 2018 for ETHBerlin [0] and in 2019 for ETHBerlin ZWEI [1].

Central-bank-issued fiat currencies devalue faster every year, with annual
inflation rates of supposedly /stable/ currencies like EUR or USD hitting new
highs each month. Over the last two years, the global crackdown on privacy,
freedom of movement, and the right to transact by governments worldwide put us
on the edge of a new dark age of regression.

We are seriously concerned about the state of the world, but equally so about
the state of the /blockchain space/. While we are absolutely over the moon for
the ever-growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain
technology, certain developments leave a bitter aftertaste, and we fear that the
most essential values are about to get lost along the way. We take this as a
call to action and want to do our part.

Please welcome ETHBerlin's official third edition:

* ETHBerlin^3 - ETHBerlin, to the power of 3.

With ETHBerlin^3, we aim to go back to the roots and remind our community what
it's all about: We want to invite you to Berlin to hack the system, now more 
than ever. We want to emphasize the original cypherpunk vision and build on it.
In addition, we aim to teach and educate a new generation of hackers about what
you can achieve with cryptography, blockchain, and peer-to-peer network
technologies.

ETHBerlin^3's north-star values are - and always have been:

* Opt for open source, and teach the risks of rent-seeking proprietary software.
* Support and focus on the builders [4]; everything else is secondary.
* Aim for distribution of power and decentralization.

Our big question for you is: How do we get from yield farming fruit tokens, VC 
chains, making the rich richer and a never-ending race to the top to an open and
an inclusive system that makes a difference in people's lives? Which anarchist and
privacy-preserving tools can we build that enable independence from governments 
and mega corps?

We will encourage hackathon tracks, workshops, and supporters at ETHBerlin^3 to
focus on the following key aspects:

* Private: there is no need for your name, data, or ID.
* Usable: it has to be accessible and user-friendly.
* Direct: it does not ask for permission.
* Subversive: it transforms established orders and structures of power.
* Social: it empowers people and makes a difference in somebody's life.
* Clandestine: it will not comply.
* Independent: it will not rely on governments or corporates.
* Impactful: it intends to make a difference.
* Secure: it does not put anyone at risk.
* Libre: it will be free both as in free speech and free beer.

Berlin has a dark history of financial scandals, hyperinflation, and bank runs.
Since inflation is again about to eat the world, we'd like to use this as a
reminder that the system we live in is not infallible, and itâ€™s up to us to
progress towards change. The fiat currencies we use every day are hardly backed
by anything at this point (money printer goes brrr); we just choose to believe
in one thing over another. We can choose to build the (financial) future we want
to live in; nothing really hinders us!

In the previous years, ETHBerlin always tried to make a difference by pioneering
the use of decentralized technologies and nurturing the ecosystem. Significant
projects emerged from our hackathons, such as IPFS Pinata [5] or the Goerli
Testnet [6]. And legend has it that even the Dune Analytics founders started
their career [7] at ETHBerlin.

Are you committing to making a difference? Expect us!
